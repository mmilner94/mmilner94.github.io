      <h2>Me, In a Nutshell</h2>
        <img src="images/good-pic-1.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="A Picture of Me">
        <p>I am a screenwriter, podcaster, and Co-Founder of <a href="https://thewodc.com">The Write or Die Chicks</a>, an Orange County based collective for emerging female screenwriters looking to find their voice, find a friend, or just find accountability for their writing.</p>
        <p>I love talking about the screenwriting process and encouraging people to pursue creative ventures. You can think of me as a sort of creativity bully, in that sense. I’ll push you, but only because I believe in your potential. Everyone has a story, and I want to know what it is! At the very least, I want you to know what it is and indulge in the process of releasing it on to paper. </p>
        <p>Let me help you find your voice, and in return I’ll lend you my eyes, ears, and heart.</p>
        <p> How I can help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proofreading</li>
            <li>Script Doctoring Services</li>
